## Projection Examples

### 1. [Single Worker](./single-worker/)

**Run it:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd partitioned
PARTITION_KEY=0 go run main.go

```

### 7. [Scoped Projections](./scoped-projections/)
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Best for:** Understanding scoped vs global projections

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Most examples require:
- Go 1.23 or later
- PostgreSQL 12+ running locally (except SQLite examples which need no database server)

Start PostgreSQL:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=pupsourcing_example \
  postgres:16
```

### Running Examples

1. Navigate to an example directory
2. Generate and apply migrations (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd basic
   go generate
   psql -h localhost -U postgres -d pupsourcing_example -f ../../migrations/init.sql
   ```
3. Run the example:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Key Concepts

### Events are Immutable

Events are value objects that become immutable once persisted. They don't have identity until the store assigns a `global_position`.

### Transaction Control

You control transaction boundaries. This allows you to combine event appending with other database operations atomically.

### Optimistic Concurrency

Version conflicts are detected automatically via database constraints. If concurrent modifications occur, one will fail with `ErrOptimisticConcurrency`.

### Projections

Projections read events sequentially and maintain progress via checkpoints. They can be stopped and resumed without losing position.

### Horizontal Scaling

Multiple projection processors can run in parallel using hash-based partitioning. Events for the same aggregate always go to the same partition, maintaining ordering.

### Checkpoints

Each projection maintains its own checkpoint in the database. Checkpoints are updated atomically with event processing, ensuring exactly-once semantics.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Graceful Shutdown

All examples demonstrate graceful shutdown:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
defer cancel()

sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)

go func() {
    <-sigChan
    cancel()
}()

err := processor.Run(ctx, projection)
```

### Pattern: CLI Configuration

Examples show CLI-friendly configuration:
```go
partitionKey := flag.Int("partition-key", -1, "Partition key")
totalPartitions := flag.Int("total-partitions", 4, "Total partitions")
flag.Parse()

// Also support env vars
if *partitionKey == -1 {
    if envKey := os.Getenv("PARTITION_KEY"); envKey != "" {
        *partitionKey, _ = strconv.Atoi(envKey)
    }
}
```

### Pattern: Idempotent Projections

Make projections safe for reprocessing:
```go
func (p *Projection) Handle(ctx context.Context, event es.PersistedEvent) error {
    // Get database connection from your application context or use a field
    // Most projections will update a separate read model database
    _, err := db.ExecContext(ctx,
        "INSERT INTO read_model (id, data) VALUES ($1, $2)"+
        "ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET data = EXCLUDED.data",
        id, data)
    return err
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### PostgreSQL Connection Errors

Ensure PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
docker ps  # Check if container is running
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d pupsourcing_example -c "SELECT 1"
```

### Migrations Not Applied

Generate and apply migrations:
```bash
cd basic && go generate
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d pupsourcing_example -f ../../migrations/init.sql
```

### Projection Not Processing

Check events exist:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;
```

Check projection checkpoint:
```sql
SELECT * FROM projection_checkpoints;
```
